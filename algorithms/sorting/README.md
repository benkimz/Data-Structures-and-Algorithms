# Sorting Algorithms:

* ### ```Heap Sort```
The Heap sort algorithm is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort the elements in an array. The algorithm builds a heap from the elements in the array and then extracts the root element of the heap repeatedly to obtain a sorted array.

* ### ```Bucket Sort```
The Bucket sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets, and then sorting each bucket individually. The algorithm assumes that the input is uniformly distributed over a range and that the elements are drawn independently at random.

* ### ```Shell Sort```
The Shell sort algorithm is a variation of the insertion sort algorithm, but it sorts the elements in the array in a series of subarrays instead of the entire array at once. The algorithm starts by sorting elements that are far apart from each other, then reduces the gap between the elements in each iteration until the gap is 1, which is the same as the insertion sort algorithm.
